# CodeAndDesignPatterns
Repository housing various assignments from ENSF619 - Special Topics (Advanced Systems Analysis and Software Design) - demonstrating usage of C/C++, Java, and Design Patterns

# About
Each folder contains the lab instructions, source code, and a compiled lab report. Learning objectives for each lab are as follows:

### Lab 1
- This lab assignment is designed to give you some experience with the process of developing, compiling, running
a simple C program, and learning basic constructs of C programming

### Lab 2 
- This lab consists of several exercises, mostly designed helping you to understand: Using arrays and built-in strings,
pointer arithmetic, and C structs

### Lab 3 
- The objective of this lab is to help you in understanding of the subjects such as:
  - C++ reference type,
  - Drawing C++ objects on the memory
  - Designing C++ classes
  - Understanding the concepts of dynamic allocation of objects, and issues with the bad-copy of C++
  objects.

### Lab 4
- This lab is aimed to help you understanding very essential topics such as
dynamic allocation of memory in C++, and concepts such as copying objects in C++.

### Lab 5
- The purpose of this lab is to practice some of the basic object-oriented design concepts such as:
aggregation, composition, polymorphism, inheritance, and multiple inheritance in C++

### Lab 6
- The purpose of this lab is:
  - Understand the concepts of overloading operators in C++.
  - Understanding and developing a simple program in Java that uses one of the important design pattern models
  called “Strategy Pattern”.
  
### Lab 7
- The main objective of this lab is to give you an opportunity to practice a few more
important design patterns: Observer, Decorator, and Singleton pattern.
